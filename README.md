# Weather Application

## Abstract

Weather is known for its unpredictability, making it essential to have access to accurate and detailed weather information. The Weather Application developed in this project aims to provide users with current temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures, humidity, and a brief description of overall weather conditions. The application fetches data from an API and displays weather-related icons to represent the current conditions. Additionally, the application dynamically changes its background image based on the weather conditions of the city entered by the user.

## Introduction

The Weather Application is a user-friendly program that allows users to retrieve weather information for a specific city. With the help of Python libraries like Tkinter and Pillow, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is built to enhance user experience. Using an Application Programming Interface (API), the program fetches real-time weather data from the internet and processes it to display accurate weather information.

## Aim & Objectives

**Aim**: 
The aim of this project is to create an advanced weather application using Python modules and leverage APIs to provide precise weather information to users.

**Objectives**:
1. Gain practical experience in working with Python libraries, including Tkinter for GUI and Pillow for image manipulation.
2. Understand how Python facilitates building interactive Graphical User Interfaces.
3. Familiarize ourselves with data storage in JSON text format.
4. Learn how to integrate APIs with Python and leverage them to fetch and process weather data.

## Features

The Weather Application offers the following features:

- Display of current temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures, and humidity.
- Brief description of overall weather conditions.
- Weather icons to visually represent current conditions.
- Dynamic background image change based on the weather conditions of the entered city.
- Attractive and user-friendly GUI created using Tkinter.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies, if any, mentioned in the project files.
3. Run the Weather Application on your Python environment.
4. Enter the name of the city for which you want to retrieve weather information.
5. The application will fetch data using the API and display the weather details along with relevant weather icons.
